# Data References

Welcome to the Data References section. This section provides essential resources for various IDs that are crucial for merchant registration, particularly in the creation of **QRIS** (Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard).

In line with our commitment to delivering seamless payment solutions, we have organized important reference data into easy-to-navigate pages. Each page features a detailed data table containing the necessary IDs for **categories**, **criteria**, **states**, **cities**, **subdistricts**, and **villages**. These IDs play a vital role in the accurate setup of merchant accounts and the successful generation of QRIS codes.

Please use the sidebar to navigate through the different datasets. Each dataset is provided to ensure that you have the correct information needed for registering merchants and expanding your business capabilities through our platform.
